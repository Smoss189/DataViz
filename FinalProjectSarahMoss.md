# FINAL PROJECT - "Hi How are u doing?...."

# The Idea:

## Outline

My final project is structured similar to a 5 paragraph essay. I’ll introduce the viewer to the idea of wanting to find more time to talk to my mom and then as they scroll through the graphs and data they will see the research unfold as I make connections and explore outside factors influencing my call time with my mom.


## Summary and Structure

For my final project, I want to create a visualization model for deciding when is the best time to talk to my mom. As she lives in Boston, we are notorious for chatting for multiple hours. I’m interested in knowing what are the contributing factors that determine the days and lenght of time that we are on the phone. I will be using my personal phone call data and comparing it to various outside influencing factors such as weather and my dad coming home from work.

The story arc will follow the comparison of various outside factors, and through them, I hope to make discoveries of what influential factors change the date and time of the calls. Initially, I will look at the most common days and times of day. Taking this information, I will compare it to multiple outside factors. The first will be the times that my Dad returns home. This will help discover if other people in our houses influences the call length or start time. I will then compare the data with weather patterns for Boston. I want to see if rain or snow has any influence over phone calls. I will also look at call times in relation to my grad school calendar. 

Some of the challenges of this data could be that the information does not correlate with any of the outside factors and that the call length, time, and day are based on more arbitrary factors. Additionally, as the data will be based on the past year, the results may not apply if any of the conditions change. 

Challenges aside, a measure of success will be if I can discover patterns in the data to help me determine the best days to have a long or short conversation. Ultimately my call to action will be for the audience to deploy a similar stragey when trying to determine best phone call times with long distance parents.


## Inital Sketches

Below is the initial expectations of graphed data. I anticipate that once the data has been compared and graphed, the comparison graphs will change depending on how to best visualize the data to tell the story.

## The Data
My primary source of data is the historical phone call data pulled from my personal phone records from January 2018 – July 2019. This data can be found at the following link: <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pIDd1de13RAsIVmHXbe5wvwMPLnILW1beU5tO1uUd1E/edit?usp=sharing>
For better legibility, phone call time of day and length of call have been rounded to extract a better understanding of standard times and length of time.  

I will use the standard time that my dad arrives home. This will help determine if their anticipated arrival homes changes the time or length of the call.

The data for the precipitation will be pulled from historical weather information on individual call dates. This data can be found here: <https://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/KBOS?hdf=1>. I have specifically chosen to use a Boston weather data set since the phone calls are always to my mom's house phone. Boston weather will directly affect the phone call as it determines if she is at home. 

For determining dates of my final exams at Heinz, I will use the publically available Heinz Academic Calendar to map the call dates and exam dates.  This will help determine if the call times and dates are related to periods I am studying for exams. The Heinz calendar can be found here: <https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/heinz-shared/_files/img/current-students/heinz-college-academic-calendar-2018-2019.pdf >

## Medium and Method

To complete my final project, I plan on using Shorthand to document the discovery of the conclusions made by the data. By following the steps outlined in my sketch above, I aim to lead the reader through the story of discovery by incorporating relevant graphics and info graphs. The aim is that the viewer will be able to follow along easily in the exploration of trends and comparisons so that they too can make the same conclusions from the data. 

For the final presentation, I plan to present using key elements of my Shorthand presentation. 


# User Research and Design

## User Research

Target Audience: 

My target audience for this project is fellow students/working professionals who worry about maintaining contact with long  distance parents while they balance busy work and school schedules. The goal of the research is to discover if there is a way to plan for and schedule lengthy long-distance phone calls without added stress.

Approach to identifying individuals in a survey:

As the survey is applicable to both students and working professionals, I identified people in both categories as well as someone who was both.

Method:

The interview will last no longer than 10 minutes. Interviewees will be given a printed copy of the graphs, moodboard and layout and be asked to take a look at them without much input from myself. My goal is to get an idea of what is clear and unclear about the data represented and get their opinion on how the data will be read without knowing all of the backstory. Comments will be recorded directly on the print outs as the subject sees fit. Afterwards, I will review their comments and ask followup clarifying questions as noted below.

Script:

"I am working on a data visualization project for one of my courses at Heinz College. I would like your input on what I have put together. Here is a printed version of the draft. It begins with my sample graphs followed by a mood board and then a wireframe of the sample website layout. Imagine you came across an article including these graphs on your google homepage and you clicked on it because the topic interested you. As you go through the graphs, please put a plus sign next to things you think work well, a minus sign next to things that don’t or you find confusing and a question mark next to something you’d like to find out more information about.”

Ask follow-up questions as necessary, and respond to any questions with further discussion. 
After they have looked through the graphics, ask the below follow up questions:
1.	"Who do you think the intended audience is for the site?" 
2.	“Do you think this information can be applicable to other situations?
3.	"What other information would you like to see here? Is there anything doesn’t seem important?"
4.	"What other questions do you have about this site, if any?"

## Sample Graphs
The below graphs were used to explain concept to interviewees

## Wireframe

The below image is my Shorthand wireframe. I chose to outline my wireframe similar to a 5 paragraph essay, introducing the viewer to the idea in the initial page and as they scroll down, they see the research unfold through different explorations of outside factors affecting the day and time of the call. Each of the graphs is themed after a common phrase or text from our conversations.(See sample graphs) The project is named "Hi How are u doing....." after the telltale text, my mom sends to let me know I haven't called in a while. This, as anyone can imagine, brings a certain amount of stress. Which is why the conclusion of the research will be a fall 2019 calendar which highlights the dates and times where the perfect stress-free days to talk to my mom will occur. This way I can plan the days we can chat, and I won't be hit with the dreaded "Hi How are u doing.." text.

## Moodboard

I chose the below moodboard colors for their calming yet homey feel. The board incorporates images and colors that feel relaxed but also organized. It includes elements of cups of tea, sofas and greengrass as these are all things I connect to feelings of home. My graphs focus on eliminating the stress from planning to talk to my mom, so I want the colors and "mood" of the project to convey the same.

# Final Data Story

## User Research Findings and Conclusions 

Target Audience:

Although intially identified as being targeted towards fellow students and working professionals, I found that the audience for the project was of interest to a much broader range of people who lived far from loved ones and wished they could make more time for catching up either by phone or in person. I was surprised by the responce the project mentioned wanting to do a similar experiment. 

To make it work for this audience I broadened my comparison factors. By taking away the comparison of the exams and including time between calls, it made the project greater reaching. 

Feedback Findings:

The interviews helped to me to refine what the viewer saw. The data visualizations that had the most significant impact where the ones that were simplest and did not mix different units of measure. All parties identified the same audience and agreed that a similar approach to managing their own time could be useful for events such as homework and time-consuming tasks, like doing laundry or monthly budgets. It could also be used for finding moments through your busy timetable for selfcare.  Overall the box and whisker plot was identified as the most complex graph.  It did not provide the information that the viewer was looking for and distracted them from seeing the data. The same was true of date comparisons. It was suggested that they didn’t care too much about the phone calls in contrast to exam dates as the results would be somewhat predictable. Some feedback also mentioned an interest in seeing time between phone calls. Given that a Gantt chart was slightly foreign to them, it didn’t convey the results in an easy to read manner. There were no questions about the mood board or wireframe choice. People agreed that the wireframe followed a logical order.

Changes made: 

After completing the user research, I simplified graphs and visual elements. I also decided to take out the connection to exam dates as it did not add to the story, and the feedback from users suggested it was predictable. I added a comparison to the length of time between calls graph. Initially, I was going to use data from the entire data set, but I decided to simplify the set and focus only on data that would inform the upcoming semester. For my final visualization, I created a data-driven calendar in the form of a bubble chart. The chart includes additional design elements that help show days that I am busy or have evening classes. To make the final visualization familiar to the reader before seeing it, I incorporated elements of the graph throughout Shorthand as icons. This helped to connect the research to the final visualization as well as be familiar to the viewer's eye.

Design Conclusions:

Along the way, it was essential to keep the mood board in mind as it helped maintain a focus when choosing themes and graphics for the Shorthand presentation. It was a challenge to maintain a story throughout without getting distracted by other non-important elements. For my final visualization, I initially included a lot of elements which were true to my actual calendar, but I found that simplifying it to a sample month created a stronger image overall. I was surprise that by including references to the final calendar visualization throughout the story helped to connect all the data together.  Throughout the project, it became clear that the simpler, the better; however, the challenge was to maintain the integrity of the data.
