# FINAL PROJECT


## Outline

## Summary and Structure

For my final project, I want to create a visualization model for deciding when is the best time to talk to my mom. As she lives in Boston, we are notorious for chatting for multiple hours. I’m interested in knowing what are the contributing factors that determine the days and lenght of time that we are on the phone. I will be using my personal phone call data and comparing it to various outside influencing factors such as work time and the Heinz College finals schedule.

The story arc will follow the comparison of various outside factors, and through them, I hope to make discoveries of what influential factors change the date and time of the calls. Initially, I will look at the most common days and times of day. Taking this information, I will compare it to 3 outside factors. The first will be the times that both my husband and my Dad return home. This will help discover if other people in our houses influences the call length or start time. I will then compare the data with weather patterns for Boston. I want to see if rain or snow has any influence over phone calls. The third factor I want to look at is my Heinz College finals schedule. Will the days that I have final exams affect our normal phone call days? 

Some of the challenges of this data could be that the information does not correlate with any of the outside factors and that the call length, time, and day are based on more arbitrary factors. Additionally, as the data will be based on the past year, the results may not apply if any of the conditions change. 

Challenges aside, a measure of success will be if I can discover patterns in the data to help me determine the best days to have a long or short conversation. Ultimately my call to action will be for the audience to deploy a similar stragey when trying to determine best phone call times with long distance parents.


## Inital Sketches

Below is the initial expectations of graphed data. I anticipate that once the data has been compared and graphed, the comparison graphs will change depending on how to best visualize the data to tell the story.

## The Data
My primary source of data is the historical phone call data pulled from my personal phone records from January 2018 – July 2019. This data can be found at the following link: <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pIDd1de13RAsIVmHXbe5wvwMPLnILW1beU5tO1uUd1E/edit?usp=sharing>
For better legibility, phone call time of day and length of call have been rounded to extract a better understanding of standard times and length of time.  

I will use the standard time that my dad and husband arrive home. This will help determine if their anticipated arrival homes changes the time or length of the call.

The data for the precipitation will be pulled from historical weather information on individual call dates. This data can be found here: <https://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/KBOS?hdf=1>. I have specifically chosen to use a Boston weather data set since the phone calls are always to my mom's house phone. Boston weather will directly affect the phone call as it determines if she is at home. 

For determining dates of my final exams at Heinz, I will use the publically available Heinz Academic Calendar to map the call dates and exam dates.  This will help determine if the call times and dates are related to periods I am studying for exams. The Heinz calendar can be found here: <https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/heinz-shared/_files/img/current-students/heinz-college-academic-calendar-2018-2019.pdf >

## Medium and Method

To complete my final project, I plan on using Shorthand to document the discovery of the conclusions made by the data. By following the steps outlined in my sketch above, I aim to lead the reader through the story of discovery by incorporating relevant graphics and info graphs. The aim is that the viewer will be able to follow along easily in the exploration of trends and comparisons so that they too can make the same conclusions from the data. 

For the final presentation, I plan to present a short powerpoint on how to find the best best day and time to talk to my mom. 


# User Research and Wireframing

## User Research

Target Audience:
My target audience for this project is fellow students/working professionals who worry about maintaining contact with distance parents while struggling to maintain busy work and school schedules. The goal is to figure out how to plan for and schedule lengthy long-distance phone calls.

Approach to identifying individuals in a survey:
As the survey is applicable to both students and working professionals, I identified people in both categories as well as someone who was both.

Script:
Begin: “I have a printed version of the draft for my final project. It begins with my sample graphs followed by a mood board and then a wireframe of the sample website layout. Imagine you came across an article including these graphs on your google homepage and you clicked on it because it interested you. As you go through the graphs, please put a plus sign next to things you think work well, a minus sign next to things that don’t or you find confusing and a question mark next to something you’d like to find out more information about.”

Ask follow-up questions as necessary, and respond to any questions with further discussion. 
After they have looked through the graphics, ask the below follow up questions:
1.	"Who do you think the intended audience is for the site?" 
2.	“Do you think this information can be applicable to other situations?
3.	What other information would you like to see here? Is there anything doesn’t seem important?
4.	"What other questions do you have about this site, if any?"


## Wireframe

The below image is my Shorthand wireframe. I chose to outline my wireframe similar to a 5 paragraph essay, introducing the viewer to the idea in the initial page and as they scroll down, they see the research unfold through different explorations of outside factors affecting the day and time of the call. Each of the graphs is themed after a common phrase or text from our conversations. The project is named "Hi How are u doing....." after the telltale text, my mom sends to let me know I haven't called in a while. This, as anyone can imagine, brings a certain amount of stress. Which is why the conclusion of the research will be a fall 2019 calendar which highlights the dates and times where the perfect stress-free days to talk to my mom will occur. This way I can plan the days we can chat, and I won't be hit with the dreaded "Hi How are u doing.." text.

## Moodboard

I chose the below moodboard colors for their calming yet homey feel. The board incorporates images and colors that feel relaxed but also organized. It includes elements of cups of tea, sofas and greengrass as these are all things I connect to feelings of home. My graphs focus on eliminating the stress from planning to talk to my mom, so I want the colors and "mood" of the project to convey the same.

## Conclusions from User Research

Findings:
The interviews helped to refine what the viewer saw. The data visualizations that had the most significant impact where the ones that were simplest and did not mix up different units of measure. All parties identified the same audience and agreed that a similar approach to managing their own time could be useful for events such as homework and time-consuming tasks, like doing laundry or monthly budgets. It could also be used for finding moments through your busy timetable for selfcare.  Overall the box and whisker plot was identified as the most complex graph.  It did not provide the information that the viewer was looking for and distracted them from seeing the data. The same was true of date comparisons. It was suggested that they didn’t care too much about the phone calls in contrast to exam dates as the results would be somewhat predictable.  Given that a Gantt chart was slightly foreign to them, it didn’t convey the results in an easy to read manner. There were no questions about the mood board or wireframe choice. People agreed that the wireframe followed a logical order.

Changes to be made:

After completing the user research, I will go back and make sure to simplify my graphs. Despite there being many different ways to display data, by talking to the various interviewees, it was clear that sometimes conventional methods of displaying data can be the simplest as well as the most desired. I will go back and change the graphs so that they are much clearer to read and the data being displayed is much more apparent. For my final visualization, I will create a more straightforward visualization, incorporating calendar days and a visualized calendar on how to choose the best day to talk to my mom stress-free.
