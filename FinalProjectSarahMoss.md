# FINAL PROJECT


## Outline

## Summary and Structure

For my final project, I want to create a visualization model for deciding when is the best time to talk to my mom. As she lives in Boston, we are notorious for chatting for multiple hours. I’m interested in knowing what are the contributing factors that determine the days and lenght of time that we are on the phone. I will be using my personal phone call data and comparing it to various outside influencing factors such as work time and the Heinz College finals schedule.

The story arc will follow the comparison of various outside factors, and through them, I hope to make discoveries of what influential factors change the date and time of the calls. Initially, I will look at the most common days and times of day. Taking this information, I will compare it to 3 outside factors. The first will be the times that both my husband and my Dad return home. This will help discover if other people in our houses influences the call length or start time. I will then compare the data with weather patterns for Boston. I want to see if rain or snow has any influence over phone calls. The third factor I want to look at is my Heinz College finals schedule. Will the days that I have final exams affect our normal phone call days? 

Some of the challenges of this data could be that the information does not correlate with any of the outside factors and that the call length, time, and day are based on more arbitrary factors. Additionally, as the data will be based on the past year, the results may not apply if any of the conditions change. 

Challenges aside, a measure of success will be if I can discover patterns in the data to help me determine the best days to have a long or short conversation. Ultimately my call to action will be for the audience to deploy a similar stragey when trying to determine best phone call times with long distance parents.


## Inital Sketches

Below is the initial expectations of graphed data. I anticipate that once the data has been compared and graphed, the comparison graphs will change depending on how to best visualize the data to tell the story.

## The Data
My primary source of data is the historical phone call data pulled from my personal phone records from January 2018 – July 2019. This data can be found at the following link: <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pIDd1de13RAsIVmHXbe5wvwMPLnILW1beU5tO1uUd1E/edit?usp=sharing>
For better legibility, phone call time of day and length of call have been rounded to extract a better understanding of standard times and length of time.  

I will use the standard time that my dad and husband arrive home. This will help determine if their anticipated arrival homes changes the time or length of the call.

The data for the precipitation will be pulled from historical weather information on individual call dates. This data can be found here: <https://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/KBOS?hdf=1>. I have specifically chosen to use a Boston weather data set since the phone calls are always to my mom's house phone. Boston weather will directly affect the phone call as it determines if she is at home. 

For determining dates of my final exams at Heinz, I will use the publically available Heinz Academic Calendar to map the call dates and exam dates.  This will help determine if the call times and dates are related to periods I am studying for exams. The Heinz calendar can be found here: <https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/heinz-shared/_files/img/current-students/heinz-college-academic-calendar-2018-2019.pdf >

## Medium and Method

To complete my final project, I plan on using Shorthand to document the discovery of the conclusions made by the data. By following the steps outlined in my sketch above, I aim to lead the reader through the story of discovery by incorporating relevant graphics and info graphs. The aim is that the viewer will be able to follow along easily in the exploration of trends and comparisons so that they too can make the same conclusions from the data. 

For the final presentation, I plan to use a final visualization of the conclusions of the data to present my final findings on the best day and time to talk to my mom. 


# User Research and Wireframing

## User Research

Target Audience:
My target audience for this project is fellow students/working professionals who worry about maintaining contact with distance parents while struggling to maintain busy work and school schedules. The goal is to figure out how to plan for and schedule lengthy long-distance phone calls.

Approach to identifying individuals in a survey:
As the survey is applicable to both students and working professionals, I identified people in both categories as well as someone who was both.

Script:
Begin: “I have a printed version of the draft for my final project. It begins with my sample graphs followed by a mood board and then a wireframe of the sample website layout. Imagine you came across an article including these graphs on your google homepage and you clicked on it because it interested you. As you go through the graphs, please put a plus sign next to things you think work well, a minus sign next to things that don’t or you find confusing and a question mark next to something you’d like to find out more information about.”

Ask follow-up questions as necessary, and respond to any questions with further discussion. 
After they have looked through the graphics, ask the below follow up questions:
1.	"Who do you think the intended audience is for the site?" 
2.	“Do you think this information can be applicable to other situations?
3.	What other information would you like to see here? Is there anything doesn’t seem important?
4.	"What other questions do you have about this site, if any?"

## Moodboard

Colors are calming yet homey, incorporating images and colors that feel relaxed but also organized. Focuing on the idea that understanding that knowing expected lenght of call time and day can relieve anxiety behind planning, allowing for greater enjoyment of the time spent.
