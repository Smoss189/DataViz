# Sarah Moss-Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for the Telling Stories with Data course at Carnegie Mellon University. 
Summer 2019



# About Me
  My name is Sarah Moss. I am August 2020 _Masters in Public Management_ candidate at Heinz College at Carnegie Mellon University. While my background is in Fine Arts and education, in my current position, I work with course programming logistics. Post-graduation, my goal is to work in the cross-section of public policy and international education. 

  My current position encourages using my analytical reasoning, and problem-solving skills and my background in education has created strong knack for organization, prioritizing, and exercising judgment. 

  I also have the unique experience of having lived in three different countries and traveled to many more. So, cross-cultural communication has become essential in my everyday life.  

  In my (somewhat rare) spare time, I am a passionate traveler. There’s nothing I love more than learning about and exploring new places.  Traveling has tremendous benefits, and I am always encouraging and providing friends, family, and coworkers with advice and insight. Even in my free time, I’m a problem solver!
 


### What I Hope to Learn
  Through this course, I hope to be able to combine my previous art education knowledge with data management tools to help create clear, communicative data based visuals. I also hope to be able to identify and report data more accurately by understanding the difference between good and bad data visualizations. Learning these skills will enable me to create and provide clearer data analysis. 



# Portfolio
  Here is where you will find all of my data visualization projects.

### Assignment 1: The Metamorphosis- A Look at the British Labour Party in 2016.

 Redesign: 
   I changed the graph based on my primary dislikes of the orginal. By seperating out the party and the individual and making the numbers visable, I felt that this helped to identify what the data was trying to display.

### Assignmnent 2: OIG's report on overcrowding and prolonged detention

#### Part 1: Newspaper version

My target audience for the newspaper version of this report is a general reader with a left leaning perspective. The info is created to accompany a human interest piece focusing on the lack of reasources dentention centers have to support family units. The graphics are to aid the reader in understanding a) the change in aprehensions since 2018 and b) the large number of detainees. The reader is not assumed to have indept knowledge of the topic but is interested in the content.

The aim of the entire infograph is to highlight the increase in family units as well note the lenght of time children are being held. For the donut graphs I chose to use red to grab the readers attention and allow for easy comparision between 2018 and 2019. In order to maintain the focus on the family unit increases, I kept the Unaccompanied Children and Single Adult data in grey but carried the Unaccompanied Child grey color down to the below infograph to maintain the connection between data. The donut visualiation allowed for the clearest visual as well as provided the ability to list year within the donut, where the readers eye was already focusing.

I chose to display the _30% of children..._ info using only 10 icons as this was the simpliest way to display the large data set. Continuing with the diverging color set, I highlighed 30% in organge but maintained the grey from the donut graph above to aid in coherance.

For both visualizations I also took into account print friendly colors as well as being colorblind friendly as graphs maybe widely distributed.

#### Part 2: Report Version

The aim of this visualization was to provide the reader with a highlighted of urgent information. The audience for this information would be one that needed the most important facts immediatly distilled in clear, easily readable graphs. The goal was to provide context and reference for the information within the report. I pulled the information from the report that seemed to need the most urgent attention - increase in families, overcrowding of holding cells as well as children's health.

I chose Times New Roman for the tile and a sans serif font for the top information to convey seriousness as well as legibility. The first graph is a simple side by side comparison graph. The choice of red and blue was to mirror the report but also to draw immediate attention. The first thing that the viewer sees in the info graph is the red bar displaying the increase in family unit aprehensions in comparison to the previous year. From there the viewers eye can travel down to the statistics of male and female cell overcrowding and shower access for children. The color choices for the imformation below the bar graph were selected so that they do not compete with the most important information but rather build on it. 

After reviewing the infogram checklist, I decided not to include specific numbers on the bar chart as it seemed to overpower and distract from the side by side comparision.

### Assignment 2: Critique #2

Source: https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-46602785

Although graphically interesting, the graph _Cars and Bikes in Beijing, China_ in BBC's _China's staggering 40's years of Change_ article is confusing. The graph provides two equally weighted images, one being a graphic of a car and a bike, the other being a bar graph. The equal weights create equivalent importance to the viewers, so it takes a moment to process that the 1st graphic is serving just as a legend for the graph below. 

When looking at the graph, the information is not truthfully represented as the bars do not display accurate sizes in relationship to each other. Additionally, having the bike on the left and the car on the right, created expectations that the graph would be organized the same way - Bike Data first, followed by Car data. However the opposite is true. This creates confusion and forces the viewer to continue to refer back to the legend. Since the title of the graph is emphasizing car use increase, having the bike data in red, the more eye catching color does not help readability but creates an inaccurate view of the data.

To fix these issues, I first decided to change the orientation of the graph. Although the original was clear, changing the orientation allowed for better understanding. Secondly, I took away the graphic of the bike and car and instead incorporated icons into a simple legend to the left of the graph. I chose the left as the viewer’s eye naturally follows the bar graph to the top and can easily jump to the legend. I also decided to choose a more neutral palette. The use of red for bike users read as negative, which is not the correct communication for this data, so changing the color created a less bias display.  I also created a greater focus on the increase in car users by narrowing down the title and using a stronger color to display the car data.  Unlike the original graph, my version does not emphasize bike users in 1978, but shows the change over the 40 years more accurately.
