# Moss-Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for the Telling Stories with Data course at Carnegie Mellon University. 



# About Me
My name is Sarah Moss. I am August 2020 _Masters in Public Management_ candidate at Heinz College at Carnegie Mellon University. While my background is in Fine Arts and education, in my current position, I work with course programming logistics. Post-graduation, my goal is to work in the cross-section of public policy and international education. 

My current position encourages using my analytical reasoning, and problem-solving skills and my background in education has created strong knack for organization, prioritizing, and exercising judgment. 

I also have the unique experience of having lived in three different countries and traveled to many more. So, cross-cultural communication has become essential in my everyday life.  

In my (somewhat rare) spare time, I am a passionate traveler. There’s nothing I love more than learning about and exploring new places.  Traveling has tremendous benefits, and I am always encouraging and providing friends, family, and coworkers with advice and insight. Even in my free time, I’m a problem solver!
 


## What I Hope to Learn
Through this course, I hope to be able to combine my previous art education knowledge with data management tools to help create clear, communicative data based visuals. I also hope to be able to identify and report data more accurately by understanding the difference between good and bad data visualizations. Learning these skills will enable me to create and provide clearer data analysis.
